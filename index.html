<h2 style="color:black;">Family</h2>
<p style="font-family:courier;"> My family and I are very close. Whether it's my brother or sister or some of my cousins that I haven't seen in ages, we all act like best friends.</p>

<h2 style="color:black;">Dog</h2>
<p style="font-family:courier;"> My dog is a 6 year old Border Collie named Bella. She is the typical black and white Border Collie with lots of energy. She is obsessed with her tennis ball and will play at any hour of the day. Unfortunately, Bella likes humans more than dogs, so we constantly have to keep her occupied. Border Collies are a great breed for farmers but if you have lots of land and people to keep them busy, they could be a great option for you and your family. But watch out, they are smarter than you think.<p>
